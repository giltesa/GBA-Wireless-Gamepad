# Game Boy Advance Wireless Gamepad

This is a“fork”of [Shyri GBA BT HID](https://github.com/Shyri/gba-bt-hid "Shyri GBA BT HID") project which allows your GBA to be used as Bluetooth gamepad.
I wanted a professional board for soldering everything, so I made it, however you have to use his code (I put a copy of his project in mine).
